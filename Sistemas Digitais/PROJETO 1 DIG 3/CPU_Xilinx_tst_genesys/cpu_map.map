  Number of Slice LUTs:                        370 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                      336 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             310
      Number using O5 output only:              18
      Number using O5 and O6:                    8
    Number used as Memory:                      32 out of   7,680    1%
      Number used as Single Port RAM:           32
        Number using O6 output only:            32
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         2
  Number of route-thrus:                        23 out of  57,600    1%
    Number using O6 output only:                19
    Number using O5 output only:                 3
    Number using O5 and O6:                      1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   131 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          407
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           243 out of     407   59%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  37 out of     407    9%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         127 out of     407   31%
    Number of unique control sets:              17

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        19 out of     480    3%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      1 out of      32    3%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        1

Total equivalent gate count for design:  7,869
Additional JTAG gate count for IOBs:  912
Peak Memory Usage:  407 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 mins 20 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 mins 15 secs
